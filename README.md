# Privacy-Surveillance

🔍 Just completed a deep-dive data project on AI & Surveillance Technologies used across the globe! 🌍📡

Using Python and public datasets, I explored how governments are adopting AI for surveillance, including facial recognition, smart policing, and social media monitoring.

📊 What the notebook does:

📥 Loads and cleans global surveillance data

🧹 Standardizes and encodes tech usage per country

📈 Performs descriptive analytics & visualizations

🔗 Analyzes correlations among different surveillance technologies

🤖 Prepares data for predictive modeling on AI surveillance adoption

💡 Key Skills:

Data cleaning & feature engineering 🧽

Exploratory Data Analysis with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn 📉

Classification modeling with RandomForestClassifier 🌲

Ethical reflections on AI and human rights ⚖️
